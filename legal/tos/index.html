        <h1>Terms Of Service</h1>

        <p>
            We don't like legal notices, and we know you don't either. We have
            no desire to police our users. We also live in a society, and we're
            not going to lie to you and say "no rulez lol" when certain kinds of
            content can get us taken offline or get our admins in legal trouble.
            Below you'll find minimum common-sense zero-tolerance rules to keep
            our community and admins safe. We've tried to write in plain
            language wherever possible. Do note that for practical reasons we
            reserve the right to revoke your accout for reasons not listed here,
            however we try to not make a habit of this. Where applicable we will
            comply with our duty as a platform to report law violating users to
            the appropriate authorities.
