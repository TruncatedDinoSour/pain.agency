        <h1>Terms Of Service</h1>

        <p>
            We don't like legal notices, and we know you don't either. We have no desire to police our users. We also live in a society, 
            and we're not going to lie to you and say "no rulez lol" when certain kinds of content can get us taken offline or get our 
            admins in legal trouble. Below you'll find minimum common-sense zero-tolerance rules to keep our community and admins safe. 
            We've tried to write in plain language wherever possible. Do note that for practical reasons we reserve the right to revoke
            your accout for reasons not listed here, however we try to not make a habit of this. Where applicable we will comply with our
            duty as a platform to report law violating users to the appropriate authorities.
