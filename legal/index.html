        <h3>Privacy Policy</h3>

        <p>
            <b>Data collection by your explicit consent</b>: We collect and process personal information from you as needed to provide the services for which you 
            register. In addition to information essential to the provision of specific services, we collect your IP address, browser type and version, date and 
            time stamps of access and referring page URLs (if applicable) as part of software logs, in line with industry standards. We retain these logs for short 
            periods of time for technical support purposes: either to fulfill our internal needs related to the maintenance and troubleshooting of 
            our services, or to assist you when you request support. We do not use this log information for tracking, analytics, marketing, or any other commercial 
            purpose, and we don't share it with any third parties.
            <br><br>
            We process your data as necessary to deliver our services and to ensure compliance with our terms and conditions. If you 
            create a public post on a discussion platform, we must process your data to display that post to other users. We may also use tools to identify and 
            automatically remove content that violates our terms and conditions. We do not share your data, or otherwise make it accessible to anyone except our 
            datacenter providers.
            <br><br>
            Our site and services are hosted by Hetzner Online GmbH and/or Porkbun LLC. You are also subject to any terms and privacy policies enforced by those 
            entities. Should this be a concern to your privacy or security we highly recommend the utilization of end to end encryption. End to end encryption 
            remains the best ally to any user's security and privacy, and many services such as Matrix offer this with little to no negative impact. End to end 
            encryption means that no one who is not given explicit access to content will not be able to decypher it, including those hosting the service. 
            <br><br>
            <b>Note regarding children's personal data</b>: Our services are targeted towards those at or above the legal age of majority (18+ as defined in the
            State of Hawaii), and children 13 or less years of age are not permitted to register or utilize our services. If you think your child may have provided
            personal information to us, please contact us immediately (as defined in our TOS) so we can remove it from our records.
